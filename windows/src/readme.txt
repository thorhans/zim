Zim Desktop Wiki Portable
=========================

www.zim-wiki.org

*Zim* is a graphical text editor used to maintain a collection of wiki pages. Each page can contain links to other pages, simple formatting and images. Pages are stored in a folder structure, like in an outliner, and can have attachments. Creating a new page is as easy as linking to a nonexistent page. All data is stored in plain text files with wiki formatting. Various plugins provide additional functionality, like a task list manager, an equation editor, a tray icon, and support for version control.

*Zim* can be used to:

* Keep an archive of notes
* Keep a daily or weekly journal
* Take notes during meetings or lectures
* Organize task lists
* Draft blog entries and emails
* Do brainstorming
